    "# Exploring Hacker News Posts\n",
    "\n",
    "This project seeks to identify trends with Hacker News Posts. Hacker News is a site where user-submitted stories (a.k.a. posts) are voited and commented upon. We will be using an abridged version of the following dataset: https://www.kaggle.com/hacker-news/hacker-news-posts. The original version of the dataset has about 300,000 rows. We are using a dataset that is a random sample of 20,000 submissions. The 280,000 rows were removed because they did not receive any comments.\n",
    "\n",
    "We will be looking at 2 main types of posts: Ask HN and Show HN. Ask HN posts are submitted when a user has a specific question they wish to ask the community. Show HN posts are submitted when a user would like to showcase a project, product, or some other interesting content to the community.\n",
    "\n",
    "We will compare these two types of posts to determine:\n",
    "1. Do Ask HN or Show HN receive more comments on average?\n",
    "2. Do posts created at a certain time receive more comments on average?"
